Specs:

 Include reasonable validations for simple model objects (list of model objects with validations e.g. User, Recipe, Ingredient, Item)
 
 Include a class level ActiveRecord scope method (model object & class method name and URL to see the working feature e.g. User.most_recipes URL: /users/most_recipes)

 Include form display of validation errors (form URL e.g. /recipes/new)
 Confirm:

 The application is pretty DRY

 Limited logic in controllers

 Views use helper methods if appropriate
 
 Views use partials if appropriate
